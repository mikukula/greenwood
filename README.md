Forest management system to alarm authorities of logging, poaching and track wild elephant movement.

## Literature 
Human-elephant conflict (HEC) is not just a threat to human lives, but also to the endangered elephants that coexist with them in certain areas around the world. Due to the increase in deforestation, elephants are forced to wander into human habitats, leading to destruction, injuries and loss of lives. Besides this, elephants are also being targeted by poachers, causing their numbers to drop fast. As a result, an efficient and time-conservative solution is required for HEC management and for elephant wellbeing. One such solution is an implementation of a deep learning (DL) model that classifies sounds into one of the three categories â€“ elephant, poacher, and others. The model then helps pinpoint the location of the origin sound and generates a report of the sound history. We achieved an accuracy of [accuracy %]. Since the program is to be used remotely, another goal of ours was to keep it as space-conserving as possible. </br>
